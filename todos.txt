DONE) Finish linking messages to persistent store
DONE) Create a list of friends view
DONE) link the contact name to the "friend" view controller
DONE) figure out why messages are coming back in unsorted order
DONE) Figure out why duplicates in my initialization of the persistent store
aren't causing any problems --> They were causing problems.  Now I check for pre-population before running that setup routine.
CANCEL) figure out the right way to link (via delegation) the persistent store and the data in the database classes --> turns out we can't use the NSFetchedResultsController in OS X... so have to do it manually or via bindings.
DONE) give the columns better headers
