IMMEDIATE:
DONE) Figure out why duplicates in my initialization of the persistent store
aren't causing any problems --> They were causing problems.  Now I check for pre-population before running that setup routine.
*) link the contact name to the "friend" view controller

CANCEL) figure out the right way to link (via delegation) the persistent store and the data in the database classes --> turns out we can't use the NSFetchedResultsController in OS X... so have to do it manually or via bindings.

INTERFACE:
*) make the text auto-resize nicely if there's more text than one line
*) make the textcell be the first responder when the app starts up
*) Fix the table view... make the columns resize and give them better headers
*) Finish the preferences window

FUNCTIONALITY:
*) Create a list of friends view
DONE) Finish linking messages to persistent store
*) Push preferences into the persistent store

NETWORKING:
*) Create a pound-define file for port numbers to use
*) remember to run checks on startup to make sure that the desired port is free
